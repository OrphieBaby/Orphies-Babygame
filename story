Many people who were unloved as babies-- when they die-- go to live on planet Foy, where they become babies again forever, and are loved by new families. [Show still art of toddler babies and their families being happy on Foy.]

But one day, a mysterious, evil baby arrived on Foy in his spaceship.

"I never had any parents, so nobody can have any parents!" he cried. And he raised his magic rattle-wand, and made all the parents disappear, turning all the babies on Foy into orphans. And then he left.

Several weeks later, while all the other orphans were still sitting and crying, one lonely orphan stood up. He had a plan. He would find the evil orphan and restore all their parents. But first he had to find help...
